# XLM_roberta-base-familiarisation

Here I document some, but not all of my inputs to the project of using translingual XLMR model for NER detection.

It is a sneak-peak into my role as a Research assistant, which is only meant to give an understanding of my abilities rather than actually contributing to anyone else's projects. It does not contain all the files that I have committed to the project as it entails working with sensitive medical data. As such I am also unable to upload the datasets that I have been working with and am only able to currently share the current results of the project.

In addition to what I have currently uploaded, we have also been working on training the model on Estonian and English data together, which gives slightly better results. However, once again, I am currently unable to share these results.
