# XLM_roberta-base-familiarisation
Familiarising myself with the XLM-roberta-base model for possible NER annotation of medical texts

This repository is created to document my learning on XLM-roberta-base model's possible usage in annotating medical texts in Estonian, using other languages as it allows for larger databases to be used.

For this purposes I first created a conda environment that could facilitate all the processes.

The main problem thusfar has been finding actual datasets tha could be used for fine-tuning the pretrained XLM model (although I am sure that more problems will arise once I find such data - no worries).

However, if given access to the databases that are public, i could potentially train the model as well.
